    <h2>Parking</h2>

    <p>
    Limited parking will be available at the church itself. Additional street parking will be
    available nearby; an attendant from the church will be on hand to recommend parking locations.
    </p>

    <h2>Public Transport</h2>

    <p>
    The church is relatively accessible via public transport for those who do not have access to a
    car. However for those planning to take public transport, please note that getting from the
    ceremony to the <a href="reception.html">reception venue</a> via public transport is somewhat
    less convenient, and <a href="reception.html#public-transport">involves two buses</a> and takes
    about an hour. Some may like to take a bus to the church and then a taxi to the reception.</p>

    <p>
    The church can be reached via the M40 bus from central Sydney. This bus leaves every 20 minutes
    from next to Wynyard Station.  The closest stop is Pennshurst St near Mowbray Rd, about a 20
    minute ride. From there the church is about a 5-10 minute walk west along Mowbray Rd.
