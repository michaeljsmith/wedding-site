    <h2>RSVP</h2>
    <p>
    We request that guests <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a> by the 15th of April, 2014. Please also <a
      href="rsvp.html">let us know</a> if you have any other queries.
    </p>

    <h2>Transport</h2>
    <p>
    Directions <a href="ceremony.html#directions">to the church</a> and <a
      href="reception.html#directions">to the reception hall</a> are provided.
    </p>

    <p>
    Guests who will not have cars for the day can <a href="rsvp.html">let us know</a> (including
    where you will be staying) - we may be able to organize a space in someone's car on the day. If
    you have spare places in your car and are willing to help out by picking up some passengers,
    please also inform us of where you will be coming from and we can try to match you up. We would
    be very grateful.
    </p>

    <p>
    Otherwise instructions for using public transport to get <a
      href="ceremony.html#public-transport">to the church</a> and <a
      href="reception.html#public-transport">to the hall</a> have been provided. 
    </p>

    <h2>Gifts</h2>
    <p>
    Gifts are not requested - we have only a small house with limited storage and already have most
    of the things we need. However some friends and relatives have been asking what they can give,
    so for this reason a Wishing Well will be present at the reception.
